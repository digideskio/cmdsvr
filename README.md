A Python web application server that was originally conceived as a method for using a single HTTP request to push data to a client throughout an entire session, removing the need for load-heavy AJAX polling.

Further development made for a capable web application server with features such as automatic mapping of URLs and queries to server methods and arguments, session management and the inclusion of Cheetah Templates.
